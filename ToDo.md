## Critical

- Fix -quipu use- and -quipu index- so that -index- creates `_path_` and -use- creates `path` (or replace in case someone saves and the var already exists).
- Add `qui` to `replace path...` in `quipu use`
- Why is `note()` (or `footnote`) not working? Also all those footnotes look like crap, need a way to disable when I want to. EG: `nofootnotes`.
- Also, need to make a distintion between i) notes I add, ii) regression notes (like clustering, etc.) and iii) variable footnotes.

## Important

- I need a way to add labels to a header. Since the variable exist, one option is to set it as header and use that. Also use varlabel for those (not just label values).
