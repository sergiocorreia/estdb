## Critical

- Fix -quipu use- and -quipu index- so that -index- creates `_path_` and -use- creates `path` (or replace in case someone saves and the var already exists).
- Add `qui` to `replace path...` in `quipu use`

## Important

- I need a way to add labels to a header. Since the variable exist, one option is to set it as header and use that. Also use varlabel for those (not just label values).
